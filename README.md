Repository for the Cities and Armed Conflict Events (CACE) dataset and the data collection methods.

The Cities and Armed Conflict Events (CACE) dataset constitutes an extension of the UCDP-GED. 
CACE provides a systematic coding of whether these armed conflict events took place in cities. 
To identify which events of armed conflict took place in cities, the data was manually matched to 
data from the United Nations Statistics Division (see the codebook for more details). 
The current version is based on UCDP-GED v 18.1.
